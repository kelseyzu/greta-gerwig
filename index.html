After acting in a series of films for around a decade, the young filmmaker burst onto the scene with her first solo project Lady Bird in 2018.

            I think my love of cinema has to do with the finite nature of it. It's a sad feeling, but it's a wonderful feeling. It was this flickering light and sound, and then it's gone.

                <p>Great Gerwig was born on August 4, 1983 and grew up in Sacramento, California. After graduating from Barnard College with a degree in English and Philosophy, Gerwig’s cinematic education came from acting in a niche known as “mumblecore” — low-budget independent films with narratives that prioritize dialogue and focus on the lives of young characters. The roles that followed allowed her to master and ultimately move beyond the art of playing the quirky best friend, culminating in the critically acclaimed 2012 film “Frances Ha,” which she starred in and co-wrote with now partner, Noah Baumbach.</p>
                <p>Her work is influenced by Woody Allen, Joan Didion, David Bowie, David Cronenberg, Mike Leigh, François Truffaut, and Vincent Minnelli.</p>
